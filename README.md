# sicp-in-clojure

[Clojure](https://clojure.org/) unit tests for exercises in 
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
([SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)).


## Usage

- `master` branch contains only unit tests and starting solution templates. Hope
  this will be a useful study resource for anyone who wants to do SICP exercise in
  Clojure. Conttributions are welcome!

- My own exercise solutions are in `my_solutions` branch

- Running tests:
  + Example running a specific test:
    `lein test :only sicp-in-clojure.ex3-03-test`
    to test your solution for exercise 3.03. Do note that we use underscores `_`
    in filenames but dashes `-` in namespaces.
